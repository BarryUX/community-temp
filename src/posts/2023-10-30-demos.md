This is a very opinionated starter, but it can be further developed in many directions. In its current form, it can already be used as a simple blog.

To avoid overloading this base with too many subtleties, I put special features such as image gallery, tags, or pagination in separate branches that (usually... hopefully! ðŸ«£ ) keep up with the main branch.
Work in progress.

## Demos

{% for item in demos %}

   <h3>{{ item.title }}</h3>
   <p>{{ item.description }} <br /><a href="{{ item.preview }}">Demo</a> / <a href="{{ item.branch }}">Branch</a></p>
