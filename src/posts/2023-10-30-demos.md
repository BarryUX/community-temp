This is a very opinated starter, but it can be further developed in many directions. In its current form, it can already be used as a simple blog. To avoid overloading this base with too many subtleties, I put special features such as image gallery, internationalisation, pagination etc. in separate branches that (usually) keep up with the main branch.
Work in progress.
